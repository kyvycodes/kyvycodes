I am dedicated to fine-tuning my skills through mentorship from more seasoned developers and tirelessly working toward self improvement by learning all I can on my own. I became an engineer to help shape the global tech landscape and a build bridge between the world I came from and the innovations I believe our future world will require.</p>
